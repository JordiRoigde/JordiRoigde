### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jordi Roig, and I consider myself a passionate student of Data Analyst and Data Science. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills in this constantly evolving field.

Currently, I am enrolled in a bootcamp where I have been learning advanced tools and techniques for analyzing and visualizing data.

I have had the opportunity to work on several projects where I have utilized tools such as Python, SQL, PowerBI, and ML. I love experimenting with new tools and learning new things about the world of data analytics and data science.

I am committed to applying my knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems and help businesses make informed data-driven decisions.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, please don't hesitate to contact me. I am excited to meet and collaborate with other professionals in this exciting field.
